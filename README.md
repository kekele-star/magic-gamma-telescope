# magic-gamma-telescope
A Tensorflow  machine learning project on the University of California School of IT and CS dataset

This repository hosts a TensorFlow-based machine learning project focused on the Magic(Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) Telescope data analysis. The MAGIC Telescope is a ground-based gamma-ray observatory located on the Canary Island of La Palma, Spain. This project aims to develop and deploy machine learning models for the analysis and interpretation of data collected by the MAGIC Telescope, with a specific focus on gamma-ray astronomy.

Introduction
Gamma-ray astronomy is a branch of astrophysics that studies high-energy gamma-ray photons from celestial objects, such as supernovae, pulsars, and active galactic nuclei. The MAGIC Telescope is an essential instrument in this field, capable of detecting and measuring gamma-ray photons in the TeV (teraelectronvolt) energy range. Machine learning techniques can enhance the analysis of this data, providing improved sensitivity and precision in the identification of gamma-ray sources.

This project seeks to develop, train, and evaluate machine learning models for various tasks related to the MAGIC Telescope data, including:

Gamma/hadron discrimination to distinguish between gamma-ray events and background hadronic events.
Energy estimation to determine the energy of incoming gamma-ray photons.
Source localization to pinpoint the origin of gamma-ray emissions.
Time variability analysis to detect transient gamma-ray sources.
